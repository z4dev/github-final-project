# Simple Interest Calculator

This project implements a simple interest calculator using Bash scripting. The script calculates the simple interest based on user input for principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Features

- Calculates simple interest using the formula:
  $$
  \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
  $$

- Accepts user input for:
  - Principal amount (P)
  - Rate of interest (R)
  - Time period (T)

- Displays the calculated simple interest.

## Usage

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-final-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash

3. Make the script executable:

   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./simple-interest.sh
   ```

5. Follow the prompts to enter the required values.
